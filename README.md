🌟 Overview

OnStyle is a Chrome extension that helps you discover your body type, analyze your outfits, and get personalized style recommendations — all with the help of your AI stylist, Auri 👗
Whether you’re dressing for brunch, work, or a night out — Auri curates suggestions that flatter your silhouette and express your style effortlessly.

💡 Inspiration

Finding outfits that actually suit your body type can be confusing and time-consuming.
I wanted to make fashion accessible, intelligent, and personal — by blending AI + design intuition into one sleek experience.

🔍 How It Works

1. Enter your details — height, weight, gender, and body type (or find out with our smart quiz)
2. Upload an outfit — or skip straight to Auri
3. Auri analyzes your look and suggests fits, colors, and styling tips tailored to you
4. Get recommendations instantly — save time, shop smarter, and express yourself better 💅

⚙️ Compatibility & Setup

🧩 Important: OnStyle only works fully on devices that support Gemini Nano and the Prompt API.

If your device is not yet compatible, the app will use a mock API where Auri’s intelligence is limited (no real-time image or text understanding).

To enable Gemini Nano and the Prompt API on your device:
👉 Follow the setup guide here:
🔗 https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api

💻 Installing OnStyle (Chrome Extension)

Since OnStyle is currently in development mode, it is not hosted live.
You can unpack and run it locally by following these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onstyle.git


2. Open Google Chrome and go to:

chrome://extensions/


3. Turn on Developer Mode (top right corner).

4. Click “Load unpacked” and select the /onstyle project folder.

The OnStyle icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar! 🎉
Click it to launch Auri — your AI stylist.

💭 Challenges I Faced

- Integrating Gemini Nano locally for private, on-device AI
- Creating a mock API fallback for non-compatible devices
- Designing a cohesive, responsive UI for both web and Chrome extension
- Maintaining a natural conversation flow with visual + text inputs
